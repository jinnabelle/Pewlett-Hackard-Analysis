# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Explain the purpose of this analysis.<br>
The purpose of the analysis is to get more information about the impact of the "silver tsunami" and the opportunies from current employees. For impact of retiring employees, I take a look at the list of retiring employees and the number of retiring employees by job title. And for opportunities, I looked at the list of employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. <br>

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed. <br>

1. There are 72,458 currently employed employees that will be retiring based on the definition by the year the employees were born (1952 to 1955). <br>
2. Majority of the company's potential retirees are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, making up ~50K employees of the 72K potential retirees. <br>
